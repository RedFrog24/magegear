# magegear
Mage tool to help gear up for battle. Options for your own pet, your target's pet or your group, and it will seek who has pets and load them up. Options for Primary and Secondary and checks the spells you have available. Go Full Terminator mode and choose Weapons, Belt, Mask, Armor and Jewelry.

>>Made for EMU up to DoN expansion, primarily for Shelter of the Banned <<
That said, will likely work on many other EMUs with less or more than DoN, but the spell lists I added are up to DoN era version. Probably works on TLP as well.
